    <h1>Can the WebVR API be polyfilled?</h1>
    <p>
      There are certain features that are possibly only by making changes to the browser platform. The most significant would the ability to traverse links.

    <p>
      We have formed a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webvr/">W3C Community Group</a>, and the spec lives in a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/">W3C repo</a>. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webvr-spec/issues/16">Standardization of the spec has not begun yet</a>.

    <h1>Can I use HTML and CSS for WebVR?</h1>
    <p>This is not currently possible. However, there has been experiments that would enable the copy of DOM element layouts into textures usable in a webGL scene. Though, this will be quite a ways out before we see anything usable by regular web content.</p>

  <article class="article faq">
    <h1>Why WebVR?</h1>
    <p>
      Most VR content today is being created using proprietary closed-source software.  WebVR enables you to build VR experiences using web technologies such as WebGL and utilize the entire bredth of APIs already available in browsers.   The Web also offers accessibility by URL, with no download and installs required and completely open platform for distributing your application.
